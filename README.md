# Animals-Memory-Blocks

This is my second project using TypeScript after the Image Search Engine. This is a project that combines one of my lovely things, which is animals, and one of the unforgettable games from my childhood.

The game is a simple memory block game with animal icons. The techniques used are HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. The website contains dark and light modes and contains the ability to choose the time for the game and the number of different images (remember blocks = 2 * number of different images). Remember to watch the time and end the game in the least wrong attempts possible. And finally, don't forget to always have fun.

Since this project is now for HighSeas. So, DM me on Slack for any reports or suggestions.
